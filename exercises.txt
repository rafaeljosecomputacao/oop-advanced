Files

Project: CyberStore

Make a program to read the path of a ".csv" file containing the data of items
sold. Each item has a name, unit price and quantity, separated by a comma. You
must generate a new file called "summary.csv", located in a subfolder called
"out" from the original folder of the source file, containing only the name
and total value for that item.

Example:

Source file:
TV LED,1290.99,1
Video Game Chair,350.50,3
Iphone X,900.00,2
Samsung Galaxy 9,850.00,2

Output file (out/summary.csv):
TV LED,1290.99
Video Game Chair,1051.50
Iphone X,1800.00
Samsung Galaxy 9,1700.00

Project: CarRentalCompany

A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to 12 hours. However,
if the duration of the rental exceeds 12 hours, the rental will be charged on a daily
basis. In addition to the lease amount, it is added to the price the value of the tax
according to the rules of the country which, in the case of Brazil, is 20% for amounts up
to 100.00, or 15% for amounts above 100.00. Make one program that reads location data
(car model, initial and final time of lease), hourly rate, and daily lease rate. The program
must then generate the payment note (containing the lease amount, the tax and total payment
amount) and inform the data on the screen.

Example 1:

Enter rental data
Car model: Civic
Pickup (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 10:30
Return (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 14:40
Enter price per hour: 10.00
Enter price per day: 130.00
INVOICE:
Basic payment: 50.00
Tax: 10.00
Total payment: 60.00

Example 2:

Enter rental data
Car model: Civic
Pickup (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 10:30
Return (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 27/06/2018 11:40
Enter price per hour: 10.00
Enter price per day: 130.00
INVOICE:
Basic payment: 390.00
Tax: 58.50
Total payment: 448.50

Project: ContractProcess

A company wants to automate the processing of its contracts. The processing of a contract
consists of generating the installments to be paid for that contract, based on the desired
number of months. The company uses an online payment service to pay installments. Online
payment services typically charge a monthly interest as well as a fee by payment. For now,
the service contracted by the company is Paypal, which applies 1% simple interest on each
installment, plus a 2% payment fee. Write a program to read contract data (contract number,
contract date, and total value of the contract). Then the program should read the number
of months to installment of the contract and then generate the records of installments to
be paid (date and amount), the first installment to be paid one month after the contract
date, the second installment two months after the contract and so on. Show plot data on
the screen.

Example:

Enter contract data
Number: 8028
Date (dd/MM/yyyy): 25/06/2018
Contract value: 600.00
Enter number of installments: 3
Installments:
25/07/2018 - 206.04
25/08/2018 - 208.08
25/09/2018 - 210.12

Generics, set and dictionary

Generics

Project: Printer

Write a program that reads a set of N integers (N of 1 to 10), and then print these
numbers neatly. Then inform what was the first value entered.

Example:

How many values? 3 
10
8
23
[10, 8, 23]
First: 10

Project: ConsultingCompany

A consulting firm wants to evaluate the performance of products, employees, among other
things. One of the calculations she needs is to find the largest of a set of elements. Write
a program that reads a set of N products and then show the most expensive one.

Example:

Enter N: 3 
Computer,890.50
IPhone X,910.00
Tablet,550.00
Max:
IPhone, 910.00

Set

Project: UserAccess

An internet website registers a log of user accesses. One log record consists of the
username and the time when the user accessed the site in the ISO 8601 standard,
separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the access log to from a file, and
then inform how many different users accessed the website.

Example:

Input file:
amanda 2020-08-26T20:45:08
alex86 2020-08-26T21:49:37
bobbrown 2020-08-27T03:19:13

Project: OnlineCourse

In an online course portal, each user has a unique code, represented by an integer. Each
portal instructor can have several courses, and the same student can be enroll in as
many courses as you like. Thus, the total number of students of an instructor does not
is simply the sum of students from all the courses he has, as there may be students
repeated in more than one course. Instructor Alex has three courses A, B, and C, and
wants to know their total number of students. Your program should read Instructor
Alex's A, B, and C course students, then show the total amount and students of it.

Example:

How many students for course A? 3
21
35
22
How many students for course B? 2
21
50
How many students for course C? 3
42
35
13
Total students: 6
